","You are an assistant that generates Python docstrings for given functions.
Here is an example:

Function:
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

Docstring:
""""""Adds two numbers and returns the sum.""""""

Now generate a docstring for the following function:

Function:
def is_even(num):
    return num % 2 == 0


Docstring:
""""""Returns the number of letters at each letter in the given number.""""""

Now you can use another function to generate a docstring for one function:

Function:

def get_new_word(word):

""""""Generates an input word. The word must be a string.""""""

In this case you can use another function:

Function:

def get_new_word(word):

""""""Generates a new word by writing the""""""",2025-07-16 13:40:25.411547
